# ShowSync

ShowSync is the app you and your friends have been waiting for! With this utility, you can easily keep video players in sync over the internet. ShowSync uses KBProxy to seamlessly and anonymously connect, at which point it provides the ability to take the timestamp from the other end's video player, or simply to pause until the other client catches up to your timestamp.

## Setup

### Requirements

- CocoaPods
	- `brew install ruby`
	- Add gem bin to PATH
	- `gem install cocoapods`

### Installation

- `pod install`
- Open `ShowSync.xcworkspace`
